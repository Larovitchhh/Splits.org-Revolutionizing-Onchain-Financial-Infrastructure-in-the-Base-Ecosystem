Developed by Coinbase, is an Ethereum L2 solution designed to scale Ethereum’s capabilities by offering faster transactions and lower gas fees while maintaining security and decentralization. As an L2, Base has become a hub for DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized applications (dApps), attracting developers and creators who need robust tools to manage onchain earnings. Splits.org’s integration with Base makes it a vital part of this ecosystem, addressing the unique financial needs of its users.Why Splits is Relevant to BaseMultichain-First Design Aligns with Base’s Scalability
Base’s low-cost, high-throughput environment is ideal for Splits’ multichain-first approach. Splits’ rebuilt app, launched in March 2024, allows users to view and manage earnings across all supported chains, including Base, in a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to switch between networks, providing a seamless experience for Base users who often operate across multiple L2s. With over 70,000 Splits created on L2s compared to 4,000 on mainnet, the demand for such tools on Base is evident.
Empowering Creators and Teams
Base has become a go-to chain for NFT platforms like Zora and creative collectives like Coop Records, both of which rely on Splits for revenue sharing. For example, Zora integrates Splits to allow artists to deploy Split contracts directly when creating or editing NFT editions, ensuring fair and transparent revenue distribution among collaborators. This is particularly impactful on Base, where low gas fees make frequent transactions and contract deployments more accessible for creators.
Compliant Payments and Accounting Tools
Splits introduced compliant payment features in July 2025, enabling U.S.-based teams on Base to collect W-9/W-8 forms, verify TINs, and issue 1099s automatically. Additionally, Splits’ accounting tools allow teams to log transaction memos, export data as CSVs, and integrate with platforms like QuickBooks and Xero. These features are critical for Base-based startups and DAOs managing contractor payments, grants, or vendor relationships, ensuring compliance in an increasingly regulated onchain economy.
